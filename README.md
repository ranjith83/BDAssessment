Assessment for BD to test the ASYNC and EVENTS

As I used a Windows 7 OS which has some limitation on development of .NET CORE application. Which took me some time to complete the activity.

Technologies Used:
Angular 6
Web API
.NET CORE framework
NUNIT Test

Implementation:
1. Observer Pattern
2. ASYNC and Events in C#
3. async/await in Angular 6
4. Nunit Testing

Couldnt able to understand the below marked lines from the assessment document so just implemented the raise events
1. When the GeneratorManager receives a number, it will raise an event for the Processor identifying the batch and number
2. When the MultiplierManager receives a multiplied number, it will raise an event for the Processor identifying the batch and number

TODO:
1. Command Pattern to implement in GenerateManager and MultiplierManager classes
2. Identifying the batch and number by Events
3. Unit Testing to be improved
