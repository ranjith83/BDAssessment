# BDAssessment
Assessment for BD to test the ASYNC and EVENTS


Technologies Used:
Angular 6
Web API
.NET CORE framework

TODO:
1. Command Pattern to implement in GenerateManager and MultiplierManager classes
2. Identifying the batch and number by Events

Couldnt able to understand the below marked lines from the assessment document so just implemented the Raise events
1. When the GeneratorManager receives a number, it will raise an event for the Processor identifying the batch and number
2. When the MultiplierManager receives a multiplied number, it will raise an event for the Processor identifying the batch and number
